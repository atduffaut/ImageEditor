# ImageEditor
Pretty simple image editor using byte data manipulation.

Use the input folder to insert the images you want to be manipulated. Multiple image editing commands have already been written in the code so using any of those is applicable.
Make sure to correct the name of the file you want edited in the code, and then chose which manipulation(s) you want to apply.
The edited image will be in the output folder. There are already test images in the input and output to demonstrate the effects of the available manipulations

The makefile should be called everytime the code is edited in order to recompile the new code
